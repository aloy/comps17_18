Aidan: "Our study is a robust test of scagnostics"
  - intro/background
  - measures/definition
  
-learning methods (how do we use scags)

methods:
- sim data (move details to appendix)
- goals: automatic signal detection (pattern)
- train model (proof of concept) +lineup training
  - results: acc, sens., spec, etc
  - compare models

results:
-actual lineup data (turk data)
  - explain experiment
    - pictures 
    - human results
    - our model results
-qq plots
  - we do poorly, people are also bad
  
discusison: we've shown that scagnostics work in these situations
  - revisit problem
  - results in context
  - based on the physical shapes of a scatter plot we can characterize plots as either signal or null
  - shortcomings & future directions (qqplot)
  - applications
  
conclusion:
  - ultimate goals
