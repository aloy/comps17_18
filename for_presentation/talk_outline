BIG PICTURE STEPS:

problem: intro to the idea of null vs  signal / visual perception
  figure out how to explain in layman's terms

first attempts
  how does perception work
  Q to the audience: what would you look for?
    shape
    spread
    

possible solution: scagnostics
  explain what they are with examples
  
transition to data, aka building our model "our study is a robust test of scagnostics"
  how we trained the model, the different ones we tried, brief explanation of random forest
  supervised 
  vs unsupervised
  application: lineups
  idea of random chance, 

proof of concept, our model seem to work: let's check with real data

turk data: we do as well!

applications & why you care


Initial Exploration of Concept, We are able to detect patterns using scagnostics
- sim data (move details to appendix)
- goals: automatic signal detection (pattern)
- train model (proof of concept) +lineup training
  - results: acc, sens., spec, etc
  - compare models

results: how do we do compared to humans?
-actual lineup data (turk data)
  - explain experiment
    - pictures 
    - human results
    - our model results
-qq plots
  - we do poorly, people are also bad
  
discusison: we've shown that scagnostics work in these situations
  - revisit problem
  - results in context
  - based on the physical shapes of a scatter plot we can characterize plots as either signal or null
  - shortcomings & future directions (qqplot)
  - applications
  
conclusion:
  - ultimate goals
