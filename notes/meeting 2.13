notes on february 13 meeting:

went over how we simulated cluster data

discussed next steps:
	want to create more simulated data and then run analysis
		ex: 
		time series data would be cool, might actually stump scagnostics
		donut-shaped data
		quadratic data with noise
		striated data
		sparse
		exponential 
		residuals
		logistic residuals
		qqplot (normal vs t dist with heavy tails)



easy: FOR THURSDAY

Logan
qqplot
sparse


Sophie 
quadratic data with noise
donut shaped data


Aidan
exponential 
time series

Cari
striated data
funnel


hard: FOR SUNDAY
logistic residuals (locate your assumptions and violate them)
simple linear residuals (violations are 1)
