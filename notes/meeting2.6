meeting on February 6:

went over what our new simulation data is

right now: let's build models to see if we can properly classify our simulated data

eventually: differentiate plots from null plots -> line up

supervised approach requires someone to rigorously build a model, and have a bunch of data in the background, in an unclassified way, the computer could decide what's different.

could we find out why things were classified as different after running unsupervised ?
	yes, probably through clustering!

now building models:

linear discriminant analysis
logistic regression
k nearest neighbors (non parametric)
trees (non parametric)
	can use if we want to do multiple groups

distances:
	euclidean
	mahalanobis

logan, cari:
logistic, trees

aidan, sophie:
LDA, KNN

coding up: Jordan Crouser

ideas: cross validation
	25 fold, check resampling chapter for figuring out numbers of folds, etc
