meeting 2.19

next steps:

thinking about how we will combine data sets:
	indicator variable about type of distribution?
	could scagnostics tell us what type of distribution we're looking at?
	thinking about use: when would you actually never know what type of plot you're looking at?
	adam: what types of features combine into certain distributions?
	ACTUAL NEXT STEPS:
		make model for each data set
		cluster, exponential, linear, funnel, quadratic, striated
		logistic residuals
		residuals
		time series
		QQ plots

	model types:
		logistic
		LDA, QDA
		random forest
		knn
		svn

	linear (already done)
	cari:
	cluster
	expo	
	funnel

	sophie:
	quadratic
	striated
	donut

	logan:
	logistic residuals
	QQplots
	

	aidan:
	time series
	residuals

	final product: what type of plot, interesting v non interesting
		line up game ?s
