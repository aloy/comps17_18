notes on meeting on march first

thinking about distance:
  so far: looking at distance from mean of plots
  option: take global null, use this as mean 
  
  inferential approach: use distribution (inferential goal)
  classification/unsupervised approach: choose one that's most different (stat learning)
  
  think about distribution of mean/median of 20 null plots, what does that look like?
  
  NEXT STEPS:
  -use median to decide most different
    decide on which statistic is best
  -leave one out and take mean for each set of 19
    take difference between odd one out mean
    whichever one is largest in abs value
  -figure out density of scagnostics, try to fit
