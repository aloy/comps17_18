meeting feb 27:

moving into line-up!

next steps:

first start with our already simulated data, making lineups
using supervised to classify based on probabilities (maybe first start with already constructed models)

different approaches to line up:
using existing models to classify probs and use probs to decide interesting
	but we want to use our other models that don't give us probs
look at all 20 plots at once, decide most different,
find some measure of center of scagnostics, and decide how far from mean
