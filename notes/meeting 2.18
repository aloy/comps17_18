working on linear regression:

interesting plots:
violate:
	constant variance
	linearity (quadratic, exponential, )


logistic regression:
interesting plots:
violate:
	independence


next steps:

go through individual data sets and run models
	check which ones are doing well, not
	if anything doesn't work well, fully explore

combine data sets to see if when looking at different data types, scagnostics prove to be a useful tool
	we should check, though is not our 
	are we looking to check only for null/interesting? or characterize based on distribution? if it can, this could prove useful


somehow move to thinking about lineups?
	signal v non signal?
	pick out one different?
	unsupervised, what would it do?
