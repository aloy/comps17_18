meeting 3.4

WHAT HAVE WE CONCLUDED:
  from linear lineups:
    - Leave-One-Out method does not seem to produce different results from using all 20 plots. 
    - Supervised methods are much more accurate than unsupervised
    - Euclidean distance is about as good as random guessing
  
   distribution do not look that fruitful
  
Currently, for lineups:

  -Using models fit on data and using max prob
    (should try randomForest, KNN)
  -can use mean/median
  
To try:

Local Outlier Factor
look for real data
resimulate linear 
ask about math approach
