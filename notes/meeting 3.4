meeting 3.4

WHAT HAVE WE CONCLUDED:
  from linear lineups:
    - Leave-One-Out method does not seem to produce different results from using all 20 plots. 
    - Supervised methods are much more accurate than unsupervised
    - Euclidean distance is about as good as random guessing
  
   distribution do not look that fruitful
